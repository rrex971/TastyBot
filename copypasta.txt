Chatting ? What the hell do you mean by Chatting ? Why do you keep saying that? Is that word funny? Is it amusing? Shut the fuck up and start using normal words, not some words with made up meaning. Seriously, this is making me so mad. You will only type  Chatting  when someone spams random fucking letters. You should really rethink your life decisions. I'm out.
Chatting HOLY FUCKING SHIT! Did you just say Honesty? Like the song Honesty made by GYZE? The band that sounds like “guys”? You’re so fucking funny! Holy shit I am laughing so much! I am literally using all my air inside me to laugh! I am choking right now. I cannot breathe. I am laughing too much. Please help me, this is a cry for help. I cannot breathe. I cannot control myself. My body is imploding and I cannot stop it. I’m going to change myself into a black hole. Goodbye.

Chatting I find it interesting that you are actually reading this instead of doing something productive. I'm not gonna stop you, I can't stop you from reading this, it's your own choice. What I'm trying to say is that reading this won't add anything good or meaningful to your life, so you are currently wasting your time. Unless you had fun reading this for some odd reason.
Whatever I'll let Mathi go fc that. He's better than me anyways. He can read higher ar. Doesn't lose stamina by singletapping and he can hit triples with his other finger and he can play ar 11 in 10 tries. He's just a well...he's just a better player than i am. He's got a bigger cock than me, more handsome, better looking, better grades, richer than me, better lifestyle, better computer, better desk, better chair, better house, better country, better everything. He's got everything
What is not for sale fossil even mean? Like a fossil that's not for sale? Why don't they just say fossil not for sale? Kinda dumb when you think about it. Or is he talking- or is he like referring to like a person, like,  Not for sale, Fossil." Why would she even be selling a fossil. She an archeologist? Oooh maybe it's about like, her selling her soul to like, oh wait. I don't think I can talk about this on stream."
i hear GYZE in the morning, i hear GYZE when i go to sleep i hear GYZE left right, in my asshole no matter where i go someone please tell me how to escape the GYZE holy shit guys. GYZE!! THE POTENTIAL. THE OSU HOUSE. GYZE! GOOD MORNING. KUROITSUU!! i'm losing my minddddddd
This is actually one of my least favorite maps in all of existence. Like I know I can fc this but this map is so fucking dogwater god awful, like, bullshit, underwater, coral reef, coffin level, graveyard, shitbag like, fucked up, cat piss, cat poop map. This is like literal like dirt. It isn't even dirt its like sand. Blown away in the Swind. So bad. Its like salt and seawater. Horrible.
Chatting osu! is dying and we need your help. I'm streaming right now, hello there. Uhh check out this poll, this poll is for the Ohio State University Rhythm Games Club grand finals bracket reset and osu! is up against Beat Saber. But osu! is losing right now, check the pinned comment for a link to the vote please vote osu! thank you goodbye.
ok and?" and? and what? suck my dick? what the fuck do you want me to say? i already got my point across to your pubic brain and here you are acting like a smug smartass in a miserable way to be funny and trying to win an argument against me cause you won't accept fair criticism
I position my pinkie 45 degrees, and if you take the sign of that and find a hypotenuse, you can figure out that your hand slows down 10% in the negative direction, if we define our positive in the right and our negative to the left we can decide, that by angling it 10 degrees we can slow down by 10%.
The year is now 2024. Edward, aka BTMC, hasn't won a PUBG game, a promise he made on the 10th of June, 2022. osu!Lazer is now the most popular game of all time. Mrekk is still number one and his gap has grown to 5 thousand performance points. I still have no bitches. As Edward still plays Musical Masterpiece - M-A(FOOLISH) [GYZE - HONESTY] , we are left to wonder: how the fuck has he still not won a game. Maybe the snipers? No, just a critical lack of skill.

@BTMC hey ed just had a random thought, but after achieving so much, top 100, 900pp score, massive amazing fanbase, you broke the rules of osu by having a gf, ur famous for a specific skill(s) (stamina, streams, spaced), what is your goal(s) when it come to osu! ?

Chatting This fucking joke of a subreddit is the sole reason I can no longer watch Suisei's streams anymore. She WAS my favourite streamer of all time, nevermind in the context of hololive. Her streams are a masterpiece especially compared to today's vtuber trash on youtube. On my darkest days, I would put her stream on and be moved to tears everytime. But the fucking basement dwellers of r/okbuddyhololive have ruined any sense of enjoyment I had watching her streams.

Chatting You know guys, I've been thinking about something. This chat has been pretty dead seeing as nobody has talked for a while now. But I feel like that's too long of a way to describe it, so I've come up with a brand new nomenclature that's gonna blow your minds. You see if you combine the word chat with the word dead you get the word CHED!
